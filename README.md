# Clicky-Game

Walking Dead Clicky-Game is a memory game that tests your memory of the Walking Dead Characters. To play the game, you must remember each character clicked on.

The user's score is incremented when clicking on an image for the first time, However, the user's score is set back to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

After the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game then restarts.
